# About the project

This is a project done to help a friend struggling in game development. I had experience with handling user interaction on the cli, so I figured to give this game a shot. After reading the game guidelines, I created a flowchart to visualize the game logic. I have only a little experience with C++, so I had to study its syntax and the best practices. I learned about structs at this time, which helped me a lot.

I had a lot of fun creating this cli game!
